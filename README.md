# Game Time (Frogger!) - Alex Bonder and Kailin Cannon - (FE Module 2)

[Live on GitHub Pages](https://lexbonder.github.io/game-time/)

## Synopsis

This is a recreation of Frogger built using HTML Canvas. This project focused very heavily on JavaScript classes, components, and parent classes.  

## Motivation

The point of the game time project was to teach us how classes interacted with each other while also giving us the opportunity to recreate a classic arcade game. Kailin and I are both gamers so we wanted to touch on things we expect to see in video games.

## Challenges

Enabling the user to pause and unpause the game was a big challenge for us since we were using the `requestAnimationFrame()` method. If we stopped and started the the game, it would speed up inifinitely. Eventually we did get the pause/unpause feature to work.

## Next Steps

We would like to implement the use of sprites rather than the squares we're currently using.
